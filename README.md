## ML State Monitor
[<img src="ml_state_monitor/ml-state-monitor-logo.png" width="200" height="150"/>](https://www.nxp.com/appswpack)

This Machine Learning (ML) application software pack, [ML-Based System State  Monitor](https://www.nxp.com/design/software/embedded-software/application-software-pack-ml-state-monitor:APP-SW-PACK-ML-STATE-MONITOR), relies on Deep Learning and enables developers to develop and deploy neural networks on MCU-based systems for building smart sensing applications that use time series real-time sensed data for system state monitoring.

The example software package provides general enablement and was designed to show how to create a **Fan Vibration State Monitoring Solution** and also through an Application Note it provides details on how to validate and evaluate the performance of a model by running it through different inference engines on different evaluation kits.

To access this application software pack, click on the GitHub button to visit the NXP MCUXpresso SDK GitHub Repository and follow the steps found in the Lab Guide to evaluate the software solution.
