This repository holds the [ML-Based System State  Monitor App SW Pack](https://www.nxp.com/design/software/embedded-software/application-software-pack-ml-state-monitor:APP-SW-PACK-ML-STATE-MONITOR) and depends on the [MCUXpresso SDK](https://github.com/NXPmicro/mcux-sdk) overall delivery (revision [MCUX_2.12.0](https://github.com/NXPmicro/mcux-sdk/tree/MCUX_2.12.0)).

This [Application Software Pack](https://www.nxp.com/appswpack) relies on the Deep Learning (DL) subfield of ML and enables developers to develop and deploy neural networks on MCU-based systems for building smart sensing applications and state monitoring solutions.

## 3. Setup<a name="step3"></a>

### 3.1 Assemble the application
You need to have both Git and West installed, then execute below commands to gather the whole APP-SW-PACKS/ML-State-Monitor delivery at revision ```${revision}``` and place it in a folder named ```appswpacks_ml_state_monitor```. 
```
west init -m https://github.com/nxp-appcodehub/ap-ml-state-monitor.git --mr ${revision} appswpacks_ml_state_monitor
cd appswpacks_ml_state_monitor
west update
```
Replace ```${revision}``` with any SDK revision you wish to achieve. This can be ```main``` if you want the latest state, or any commit SHA.

### 3.2 Build and run the application
To build and run the application please refer to the [Lab Guide](https://community.nxp.com/t5/eIQ-Machine-Learning-Software/Application-Software-Pack-ML-State-Monitor/ta-p/1413290?attachment-id=153366) or check the steps in [Run a project using MCUXpresso IDE](https://github.com/NXPmicro/mcux-sdk/blob/main/docs/run_a_project_using_mcux.md).

### 3.3 Hardware settings
To configure the hardware settings please refer to the [Lab Guide](https://community.nxp.com/t5/eIQ-Machine-Learning-Software/Application-Software-Pack-ML-State-Monitor/ta-p/1413290?attachment-id=153366) or follow the readme guidelines for the specific board and application that are located in the following path   `ml_state_monitor/mcu_app/boards/<board_name>/<application_name>/readme*`.

## 4. Results<a name="step4"></a>
This Application Software Pack provides support to develop and deploy neural networks on MCU-based systems for time-series data. It illustrates how to build and deploy on embedded devices neural network models capable to monitor the input sensor data and detect the state of a device.

Please refer to [AN13562](https://www.nxp.com/webapp/Download?colCode=AN13562) document which demonstrates through a real use case the steps required to produce and assemble a dataset, define the architecture of a neural network, train, and deploy a model on an embedded board by leveraging the NXPâ€™s SDK and the eIQ technology.
This document also shows which metrics to use and how to evaluate the behavior of a neural network model at runtime on an embedded board, as well as benchmarks and performance results.
